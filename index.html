      <p>People are so quick to call a girl crazy! For Luiza’s Core III class, I started with the belief that crazy girls don't exist, and from there I explored the narrative of girls online and the conditioning of girlhood.

        <span id="opener1" class="press">Girl as Doll/Dog</span>
        is a compilation of conversations, mainly on TikTok, surrounding how girls should be. Girls are expected to be selfless and to behave like dolls. When a girl steps outside of these expectations, she is viewed as a wild dog that needs to be captured and tamed. If she chooses to embrace being “crazy” or “selfish,” men try to reclaim their power over her by going online to talk about how much they love crazy!

        is a booklet that expands on the idea of girls as dolls and dogs. It dives deeper into the various ways girls are tamed. All of which views girls as, and wishes for them to be, vessels for projections and ideals. <br>

Selfless? She doesn't have a self? and that’s supposed to be the thing to strive for. </a></p><p></p>

      <p><a href="https://apollosagirl.substack.com/p/girlhood-on-print-zines-first-issue" target="_blank">The first examples of femininity presented to me were through my upbringing in a household of extraordinarily beautiful women. The women in my family; my grandmother, aunts, cousins, and my very own mother, were all known for their beauty in their time, it glowed out of them. On top of that, they were extremely well dressed and mannered. They never spoke out of turn, expressing emotion in glances, and rage in backhanded compliments, always hiding the depths of what they felt in smiles. They were shining jewels for the powerful men in my family to assert their wealth and power with. My mother once told me that it is looked down upon for a man in Colombia to have an ugly wife, because if he had money he’d provide her the necessary cosmetic procedures to make her beautiful.</a></p><p></p>

They held themselves to the highest standard of female expression. They saw me as one of them, and educated me as such, though I never quite caught their sight of their vision. I was “too much” in the way little girls were never supposed to be; always full of bruises on my legs from careless falls, and stains over my dresses from playing with paint and food. I was quite vocal and extremely opinionated from a very early age.</a></p><p></p>
