        <p>People are so quick to call a girl crazy! For Luiza’s Core 3 class, I started the class with the belief that crazy girls don't exist, and from there I explored the treatment of girls online.

        <span id="opener1" class="press">Girl as Doll/Dog</span>
        is a compilation of conversations on TikTok surrounding how girls should be. Girls are expected to be selfless, to behave like dolls. Dolls are subject to the control of others to serve as entertainment. When a girl steps outside of these expectations, she is viewed as a dog that needs to be captured and tamed. To reclaim power over these crazy selfish girls and turn that back into dolls, men go online to talk about how much they love crazy!

        is a booklet that expands on the idea of girls as dolls and dogs. It dives deeper into the various ways girls are tamed:
        <ul>
            <li>Placing expectations of selflessness and sacrifice onto girls at a young age</li>
            <li>Instilling a sense of guilt and inferiority</li>
            <li>Containing girls into digestible forms through internet archetypes (clean girls, candid gfs, etc.)</li>
            <li>Villainizing girls for refusing to conform</li>
            <li>Scrutinizing the stripped version of a girl they’ve created in their mind</li>
        </ul>
        All of which views girls as, and wishes for them to be, vessels for projections and ideals. <br>
        This booklet focuses more on the experiences of girls told by girls, rather than showcasing the first-hand behaviors listed above. <br>

        My final project is a <span id="opener3" class="press">mirror</span> that takes a step back and asks the viewer how they expect others to behave, giving an opportunity to see if their view of others is a projection of what they feel is expected of themselves, and questioning where those expectations come from.

Selfless? She doesn't have a self? and that’s supposed to be the thing to strive for.</a></p>

        <p> It's cool being here, and a few years having passed, I feel like this is probably the period where I've changed the most in my adult life. I don’t know who here is sort of in, or has been in, their mid-20s, but I found that it was a period of great self-discovery. And for me, it's been as much about gaining things as it has been throwing things away; things that are of no real value to you, that maybe you were taught should be of value to you. And that is the incredible thing about our beautiful, lucky lives that we lead, there's so much that we can choose. We can say “no, that's not my vibe, not gonna do it.” Maybe there's something you used to do that felt really, really important to you, but now you're like “nope.” For me, actually, that was thinking I had to be a certain size. My whole life, I thought that's what being a woman is, it's this smallness, it's containment of the self. And that was really difficult for me, I always felt I was too much. And it wasn't until I let go of that that I really became someone. All of a sudden I was like “here she is, the woman that I hoped would emerge.” So you know if there's anything that you feel you grip tight to and you're like, “I don't even know why I do this thing, it doesn't help me,” I invite you to say a little something and flick it out, let it go, because my life has gotten so much richer the more layers I peel back. I don't want there to be anything between us; the less there is between us, the bigger this feels. Here I am in all my, I don't know, gore and glory.</p>

        <p>The first examples of femininity presented to me were through my upbringing in a household of extraordinarily beautiful women. The women in my family; my grandmother, aunts, cousins, and my very own mother, were all known for their beauty in their time, it glowed out of them. On top of that, they were extremely well dressed and mannered. They never spoke out of turn, expressing emotion in glances, and rage in backhanded compliments, always hiding the depths of what they felt in smiles. They were shining jewels for the powerful men in my family to assert their wealth and power with. My mother once told me that it is looked down upon for a man in Colombia to have an ugly wife, because if he had money he’d provide her the necessary cosmetic procedures to make her beautiful.</p>

        <p>These women in my family were not human, they were dolls, and I was blind to their dehumanization at the time because there is nothing a young girl loves more than her dolls. They held themselves to the highest standard of female expression. They saw me as one of them, and educated me as such, though I never quite caught their sight of their vision. I was “too much” in the way little girls were never supposed to be; always full of bruises on my legs from careless falls, and stains over my dresses from playing with paint and food. I was quite vocal and extremely opinionated from a very early age.</p>

        <p>...I watched many of my friends during their teenage yers lock their inner whores deep inside of themselves after being publicly shamed for daring to explore the sexuality they’d been gifted in growing adolescence [...] They were messy, but they were brave. When one is given the power that is sexual desire without method or context, what else can one expect? More so in a society that will find a way to villainize you for it regardless of the way it’s used.</p>
